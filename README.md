Credits for the original game to https://llerrah.com/cattrap.htm

This version is a cleaned up version of the original. Performance and memory issues fixed as well as various other bugfixes. Added music, sound effects, a dark theme option, smooth animations, and made the game more playable on touchscreen devices.

TODO:
- Fix the cat on Firefox
- Perhaps some kind of a menu with levels
